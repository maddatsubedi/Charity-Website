                    At St Mungo’s we continue to work tirelessly to end homelessness and change
                    lives for the better. Our vision is that everyone has a place to call home and can fulfil their
                    hopes and ambitions.

                    No two experiences of homelessness are the same. That’s what makes our holistic
                    approach at St Mungo’s so important, and why our range of services is so broad.

                    Every single person we work with has their own journey into homelessness and through recovery.

                                should be to contact your local authority’s Housing Options team to find out what help
                                they can offer.

                                    <li>Longer-term accommodation – independent living or social housing. If possible,

                                        should approach the council you have a local connection to, usually in the area
                                        you’ve
                                        most recently lived.</li>

                                If you are currently sleeping on the streets, use StreetLink. This is the national rough

                                authorities, and other homeless organisations about your situation and where you are
                                sleeping rough. They will then connect you to local support and help you.

                                StreetLink’s volunteers and staff will help you as soon as they can – but please don’t
                                wait. Seek other help in the meantime if you can. For example, contacting your local
                                council, or visiting a day centre.

                                You can find the nearest option for you by looking at Homeless Link’s searchable
